# ThirtySeven
The ThritySeven is the application same with [ThirtySix](https://github.com/AbnerLin/ThirtySix). But the develop tools are different, ThirtySix is based on Java with the Spring framework(spring-mvc, spring-data-jpa, spring-security etc), and its front-end are just using jQuery, Bootstrap without any framework. In this version, we'll use another programming language to develop back-end, and using some framework for developing front-end, so below.

## Back-end
We will use the Node.js(v8.x.x) for RESTful API, and use Sequelize to access database.

## Front-end
We will develop two version of front-end, one is using the Angular([ThirtySeven-Angular-Smile](https://github.com/AbnerLin/ThirtySeven-Angular-Smile)), and second is using React([ThirtySeven-React-Smile](https://github.com/AbnerLin/ThirtySeven-React-Smile)).
