# ThirtySeven
The ThritySeven is the application same with [ThirtySix](https://github.com/AbnerLin/ThirtySix). But the develop tools are different, ThirtySix is based on Java, and using the Spring framework(spring-mvc, spring-data-jpa, spring-security etc), and its front-end just using jQuery without any framework. In this version, we'll use another programming language to develop back-end, and use some framwork for developing front-end, so below.

## Back-end
    We will use the Node.js(v8.x.x) for RESTful API.

## Front-end
    We will use the AngularJS2 to develop front-end.
